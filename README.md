# Feedback Form

This is a simple feedback form built using React. Users can submit their feedback, which is then sent to a designated API for processing. The application includes a clean user interface and handles form submissions efficiently.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The form is designed to be mobile-friendly and adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Real-Time Validation**: Required fields ensure that users cannot submit the form without filling out all necessary information.
- **Feedback Submission**: The form data is sent to an external API using a POST request.
- **User Experience**: Upon successful submission, the form resets for new entries.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Styling the component for a modern look.
- **Web3Forms API**: A service for processing form submissions.
